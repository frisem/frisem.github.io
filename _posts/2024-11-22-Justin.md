# Learning from Simulated and Observed Experiences

Our capacity to explain, plan, and reason flexibly about the world depends on an accurate mental model of our environment. How do we come to learn this? Canonical cases of learning across natural and artificial minds have focused on updating our representations on the basis of novel observations. However, human minds can also preserve and generate new insights from existing knowledge: we can "learn by thinking." In this work, we investigate a particular form of learning by thinking - learning through counterfactual simulation. We present a task where participants navigate a gridworld environment characterized by an underlying probabilistic structure, learning to optimize their strategies through repeated interactions. In a between-subjects manipulation, we ask some participants to then simulate counterfactual scenarios, enabling us to test whether such reasoning enhances learning. We find pilot evidence suggesting that while subjects improve their navigation strategies over time, prompting participants to reason counterfactually does not lead to improved learning. We conclude with exploratory modeling work examining potential mechanisms for how counterfactual learning might work in principle and discuss implications for future research.
