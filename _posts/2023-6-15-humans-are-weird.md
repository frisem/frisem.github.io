title: Humans are Weird
speaker: Ben Prystawski

I've recently made a brave foray into the area of *actually running studies with humans*. Apparently some psychologists ask people to do tasks and measure the results? The whole thing sounded weird to me, but I gave it a try. The results were noisy and incomprehensible. Some people just wrote "Yeehaw!" for all their responses. Overall, I don't think this method is very promising for future research, so I discuss alternative directions in the field of Just Playing With Language Models.
