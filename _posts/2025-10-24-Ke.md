title: A Bayesian Account of Selective Truths and Epistemic Vigilance
speaker: Ke 'Kay' Fang

Abstract: How do we learn from people who may be trying to persuade us? Under classical accounts of belief updating, persuasion puts learners in a bind: either we believe everything we hear and risk being misled, or we trust nothing and learn nothing. Recent work has proposed epistemic vigilance as a potential solution: rather than passively accepting or rejecting information wholesale, learners reason about the speaker's goals and calibrate accordingly. But how does epistemic vigilance actually work? We hypothesize that theory of mind mechanisms underlie both how speakers persuade and how listeners resist persuasion. We formalize this hypothesis in a computational model, presenting a series of simulations demonstrating that: (1) speakers strategically rely on vague language to influence listeners' beliefs, and (2) listeners are able to use theory of mind to form accurate beliefs despite biases in reporting. Our findings suggest that social reasoning is key to resisting persuasion: listeners can infer whether to trust a source based on what they say and how they say it, even without knowing what's actually true.
