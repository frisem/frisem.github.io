In this talk, I will present some results that will blow everyone's mind and ruin all other talks you will ever see in the future. I begin with a proof of the Riemann hyopthesis, then show how it informs a scientific theory of consciousness. I conclude by conclusively demonstrating that the brain does indeed have priors.
