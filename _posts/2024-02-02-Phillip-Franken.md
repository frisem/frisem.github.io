title: The case for psychometrics: Studies in early word learning
speaker: Alvin Tan
---

Psychometric approaches have provided nuanced and sophisticated methods to measuring mental constructs and processes, but they have been relatively underutilised in cognitive science. In this talk, we present a pitch for the use of psychometric methods in cognitive science, considering its application in the context of early word learning. In Study 1, we examined predictors of word difficulty, finding broad consistency across languages and variability that reflected language family relationships. In Study 2, we examined the role of translation equivalents (e.g., “cat” and “gato”) in bilingual word learning, finding that they provide an advantage in word learning, especially for younger children. These studies, along with other current and future work, demonstrate the utility of psychometrics in understanding item variability, individual differences, and formal theories in cognitive science.
