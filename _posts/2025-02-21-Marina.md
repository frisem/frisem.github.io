# Excess Capacity Learning

How do humans learn from experience? Cognitive science has assumed that discovering generalizable patterns requires that humans compress rich and noisy experiences by discarding irrelevant details. However, recent computer science results suggest otherwise—systems can learn by ‘overfitting’ and expanding all the details of their experiences. I this talk, I will introduce a taxonomy of learning regimes based on a cognitive system’s representational capacity, which can be constrained (forcing the system to compress details of past experiences), sufficient (to memorize past experiences), or excess (allowing the system to expand on the details of past experiences). I will review some evidence suggesting that excess capacity systems can exhibit many of the characteristics of human learning, such as our simultaneous ability to memorize individual experiences and generalize knowledge to new situations. Finally, we will discuss the broader implications of excess capacity learning across cognitive, clinical, and developmental contexts.
