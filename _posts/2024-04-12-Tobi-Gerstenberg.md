title: Tobi's Tips and Tricks
speaker: Tobi Gerstenberg

I will share some tips and tricks that help me with my work, my life, and how to balance the two. On the work side, I'll cover email, calendar, to-do lists, project management (github, slack, meeting slides), window management, keyboard shortcuts, writing tools and Alfred (a great productivity tool!). On the life side, I'll talk about focus, friends, exercise, hobbies and meditation. I'm looking forward to sharing what's been helpful for me, and to learning from you how you do things!
