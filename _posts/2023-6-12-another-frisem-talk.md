title: Towards a Cognitive Neuroscience of Orange Picking
speaker: Josh Wilson
---

In this talk, I present a recent foray into a new line of research: the cognitive neuroscience of gleaning. I paid some poor souls to pick oranges from a tree on campus with one of those fancy MEG helmets on their heads and looked at which bits of the brain lit up when they were picking the oranges. It turns out that ares most associated with annoyance were active. The implications of this are unclear. I discuss directions for future work as well as ethical implications.
